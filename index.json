It has been well-studied within the medical domain. The need for deidentification technology is increasing, as privacy-preserving data handling is in high demand in many domains. In this paper, we focus on job postings. We present JOBSTACK, a new corpus for de-identification of personal data in job vacancies on Stackoverflow. We introduce baselines, comparing Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer models. To improve upon these baselines, we experiment with contextualized embeddings and distantly related auxiliary data via multi-task learning. Our results show that auxiliary data improves de-identification performance. Surprisingly, vanilla BERT turned out to be more effective than a BERT model trained on other portions of Stackoverflow.","tags":[],"title":"De-identification of Privacy-related Entities in Job Postings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristian Nørgaard Jensen","Nicolaj Filrup Rasmussen","Marco Placenti","Thai Wang","Barbara Plank"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1607731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607731200,"objectID":"1f748733129d6807a372df78fdda2cba","permalink":"/publication/semeval-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/semeval-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes a system that aims at assessing humour intensity in edited news headlinesas part of the 7th task of SemEval2020 on “Humor, Emphasis and Sentiment”.

We empirically assess three strategies to model the two-layer NE annotations, cross-lingual cross-domain transfer from German versus in-language annotation, language-specific versus multilingual BERT, and the effect of lexical normalization on Danish NE. Our results show that the most robust strategy is multi-task learning which is rivaled by multi-label decoding, transfer is successful also for zero-shot, and in-language BERT and lexical normalization works the best on the least canonical data. However, our results also show that out-of-domain remains challenging, while performance on news plateaus quickly. This highlights the importance of cross-domain evaluation of cross-lingual transfer.","tags":[],"title":"DAN+: Danish Nested Named Entities and Lexical Normalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristian Nørgaard Jensen"],"categories":["Python"],"content":"","date":1594729555,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594729555,"objectID":"f15dc5972611598396cee255c555af63","permalink":"/project/neat/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T14:25:55+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/neat/","section":"project","summary":"This repository contains a wrapper for the NEAT (Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies) Algorithm.

The task has a continuous label space contrary to much previous work, which has mostly concerned itself with discrete (and often binary) classification. Using a combination of techniques the regression model seeks to incorporate many aspects of humour. By combining modern neural encoders with classical hand-crafted features and neural language models we hypothesise that it is possible to capture many perspectives of the complex task. By comparing a variety of configurations to relevant baselines we conclude that the proposed model performs well. An ablation study shows that the main contributor to the models success is the neural language model. By analysing the components further the work seeks to explore why this is, and proposes some possible answers for why the components underperform, and how this can be addressed in future work.","tags":[],"title":"BSc Thesis: Assessing Humour in Edited News Headlines using Hand-Crafted Features and Online Knowledge Bases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolaj Filrup Rasmussen","Kristian Nørgaard Jensen","Marco Placenti","Thai Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569542400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569542400,"objectID":"e35c85630a78a5e786f3bae990fb3c59","permalink":"/publication/nodalida-paper/","publishdate":"2020-05-15T16:17:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nodalida-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the differences between reviews in different product categories, creating a general model for crossdomain sentiment classification can be a difficult task. This paper proposes an architecture that incorporates domain knowledge into a neural sentiment classification model. In addition to providing a cross-domain model, this also provides a quantifiable representation of the domains as numeric vectors. We show that it is possible to cluster the domain vectors and provide qualitative insights into the interdomain relations. We also a) present a new data set for sentiment classification that includes a domain parameter and preprocessed data points, and b) perform an ablation study in order to determine whether some word groups impact performance.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification using Vector Embedded Domain Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
